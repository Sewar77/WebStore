            Hey there! We're Farmgirl Flowers.
        </h1>
        <p class="textaboutone">
            We ship our signature burlap-wrapped flower bouquets, shippable vases, single variety arrangements, plants
            and more to recipients (like you!) coast to coast.

            Farmgirl Flowers is the only large scale, female-founded and predominantly female-run ecommerce flower
            company. Why is that important? The gifting and receiving of flowers is usually done by women, for other
            women. So when it comes to deciding all the little details that make a Farmgirl bouquet we go the extra mile
            because we are the customer. We design the type of arrangements we would want to receive ourselves. And that
            means everything - from the type of flower in the bouquet to the bow we wrap it up with - matters.

        <p>Our motto.</p>
        <p>We've always done things a little differently at Farmgirl. Launched in San Francisco back in 2010 by founder
            and CEO Christina Stembel, our business model from the beginning has been you order, we pick, they're happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does this mean? Instead of choosing what goes in your bouquet we do the picking from the best of the
            best our growers have to offer. That means all of our mixed arrangements, like our burlap-wrapped bouquets
            and vases, are all a little different - and just as unique as your recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like to dot your i's and cross your t's? We get that too! Our single variety arrangements, like our tulip
            bunches and dozen garden roses, are the best pick when the type of flower matters.
